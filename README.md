## Inspiration

Wanted to practice some React fundamentals as well as build a fun app around one of my favourite games

## Process

- Create a React app and install styled components
- Find [Futura Black](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Futura-Black) font
- Create initial components required for the game: `Tetris`, `StartButton`, `Stage`, `Display` and `Cell`.
- Create a helper function which renders the stage.
- Create shape for each tetromino and a function to randomise it.
- Style the webpage using styled components.
  - Create `Description` component which sets out the [rules](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-game-explained-an-example-of-a-single-game-and-how-it-meets-the-rules-of-fun#:~:text=as%20you%20can.-,Rules,needed%20structure%20to%20our%20play.) of the game.
- Create custom hooks: `useInterval` (_borrowed from Dan Abramov_), `usePlayer`, `useStage` and `useGameStatus`
- Collision detection to stop tetrominoes from moving outside of the game grid and losing shape.
- Rotate the tetrominoes by 90 degrees. Collision detection is included here too
- Clear the rows when tetris occurs and add a drop time, so the tetrominoes drop automatically
- Add scoring system
