## Inspiration

Wanted to practice some React fundamentals as well as build a fun app around one of my favourite games

## Process

- Create a React app and install styled components
- Find [Futura Black](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Futura-Black) font
- Create initial components required for the game: `Tetris`, `StartButton`, `Stage`, `Display` and `Cell`.
- Create a helper function which renders the stage.
- Create shape for each tetromino and a function to randomise it.
- Style the webpage using styled components.

In Progress ...
